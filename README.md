Rigth now i just have the basic structure of a react native app. 

This is just a sideproject of a future MVP that i wanted to develop with some friends. 
Probably this repo will just contain the basics of an app made in react native and it will not be the final code for the startup itself. 

# Important Features that i want to implement in the APP: 
 
- Login using Microsoft azure web services. (firsts steps)
- A feed just like instagram  (firsts steps)
- How to integrate the app with playments via credict card, maybe we will use the bancard API (for future)
